This is a very simple program that decodes C64 basic files in the PRG format and was slightly inspired by Detox64 (https://github.com/vroby65/detox64), which is written in C.

It has been written in Pascal and builds easily with FreePascal. It should be possible to build an use under any platform supported by the FPC.
